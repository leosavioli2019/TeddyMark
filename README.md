## How to use 

![How To use](teddymark.gif)

## Why?

HTML is a very verbose language and is very difficult fore starters,
and markdown is very very simple, but you can not put atributes, like:
id, class, style and name. So I created a language as simple as markdown,
but you can add this. The name is the union if Teddy the name of my dog and
mark because is a Markup language

## Tags

Also thera are more tags in TeddyMark then markdown, if you want to put a form 
you can use this:

```
{[]}
  ???(type="text")???
{[]}
```

But Lets start in the start. If you want to put a title in markdown you use this:

```
# Title
```

In TeddyMark

```
# Title #
```

And if you want to put an Id:

```
#(id="id") Title #
```
