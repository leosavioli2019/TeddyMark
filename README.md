# TeddyMark

A simple hypertext language based on [Markdown](https://github.com/topics/markdown)

## Why?

HTML is a very verbose language and is very difficult fore starters,
and markdown is very very simple, but you can not put atributes, like:
id, class, style and name. So I created a language as simple as markdown,
but you can add this.
